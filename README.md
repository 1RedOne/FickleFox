What's the purpose of this mod
====================
The themes and goals here are cute art and fun new options for all phases of the game, *especially late game / naninf*.  

I felt that it would be fun if there were more long term options available for late / end-game, and especially if these new jokers were fun or changed the way you play the game!


What's in this mod
====================
This mod contains a lot of fun stuff, including 40+ fun and original Joker ideas, all of which have lovingly handcrafted art and deep interactions with each other as well as the full set of original Jokers from the base game!  

### 40+ new jokers!
### 5+ new boosters
### New Editions, Vouchers, Decks and more!
